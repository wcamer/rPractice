# Overview

This is project was an introduction to the coding language R.  This program is made up of an in progress "hide and go seek" game and a couple of components that work conceptially in isolation.  


The main purpose of this project was to learn and explore the world of R and see how well it fits in my skill set of other coding languages.  As this is my first time with "R", it presented itself as challenge but, overall was a good learning experience.  The main majority of the program is a hide and go seek game that is still in progress.  Essentially the idea of the program is that a user and a CPU would pick a point on a grid and they would take turns trying to pick a point where their opponent is at.  The full vision would expand the field from an X and Y plane to a Zn plane (Zn would be like multiple levels like underwater or airborne).

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Something to fix, I would fix how the guesses are kept track.  My original vision had all guess plotted on a graph so the player can visually see where they have guessed and where to plan to strike next.
- Something to improve, I would improve the try reworking a way to use a data frame as a scoreboard.
- Something to add in the future, my original vision was battleship but, I would have the field be an array with different dimensions that can represent underwater vessels or planes in the sky as opposed to only playing on "1 level".
